# BE_Final-Project
A smart traffic signal control system powered by Raspberry Pi 4 that uses audio sensors, a machine learning model to detect emergency vehicle sirens, and real-time image processing to monitor traffic flow. The system dynamically prioritizes emergency vehicles and optimizes signal timing to reduce congestion and response delays.
